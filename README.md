## Blogs

Six questions are answered in the Blogs section. Below are the questions:

```
1 How will you improve the performance of a React Application?

2 What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?

3 How does prototypical inheritance work?

4 Why you do not set the state directly in React. For example, if you have const [products, setProducts] = useState([]). Why you do not set products = [...] instead, you use the setProducts

5 You have an array of products. Each product has a name, price, description, etc. How will you implement a search to find products by name?

6 What is a unit test? Why should write unit tests?
